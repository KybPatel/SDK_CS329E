We are considering working with the following datasets: 

Smart Mobility (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/willianoliveiragibin/smart-mobility) 
Questions: 
Is there a direct correlation between specific Weather_Condition types (e.g., Heavy Rain) and a decrease in Traffic_Speed_kmh?
Are accidents randomly distributed, or do they cluster around specific coordinates?

Airline Fight Routes in The US [1993-2024] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oleksiimartusiuk/all-airline-fight-routes-in-the-us)
Which city pairs (departure to arrival) consistently show the highest passenger demand?
Do specific quarters (e.g., Q4 for holidays) show reliable spikes in passenger numbers or fares across all years?
Can we predict next year's average fare for a route based on its Miles, Quarter, and historical Passenger data?
